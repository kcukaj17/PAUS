# Construction Company Management System 

As far as we have seen, the probability of a construction company to have its own personalized and customized system for managing the business is very rare in Albania. Knowing this fact, a solution for most of the problems of the business would be a program that would be efficient and effective in dealing with these problem. A program that will provide tools to manage not only financial but also technical aspects.

Our group thought that we could build a system that could come in use to an existing company (Druri Shqip Sh.p.k.). This system will help the company with the daily activities by coordinating everyoneâ€™s work. The program will also cover the processes of planning, coordinating, and controlling different projects that are executed by existing teams in the company. This will cover most of the work done by hand or by phone, which is time consuming, not efficient and can lead to certain misunderstandings or problems.

The goal is to be able to build a communication bridge between every employee in this business. Through the program, the tracking of the resources and assets, as well as monitoring of the costs, progress and the performance of the workforce will be easier. This way the business can achieve what is called competitive advantage in the existing market.
